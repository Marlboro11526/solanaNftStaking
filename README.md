<p align="center">
    An open protocol for launching liquidity mining programs on Solana.
</p>

## Background

Quarry was built with the intention of helping more Solana projects launch on-chain liquidity mining programs. It is currently standard for projects to manually send tokens to addresses-- while this is better than no distribution, it would be much better for the growth of the ecosystem if liquidity mining programs were composable and enforceable on-chain.

## Note

- **Quarry is in active development, so all APIs are subject to change.**
- **This code is unaudited. Use at your own risk.**

## Documentation

Documentation is a work in progress. For now, one should read [the end-to-end tests of the SDK](/tests/mintWrapper.spec.ts).

We soon plan on releasing a React library to makes it easy to integrate Quarry with your frontend.
